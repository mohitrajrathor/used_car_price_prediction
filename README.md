# Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict the selling prices of used cars, using detailed automotive information. The dataset provides valuable insights, assisting buyers, sellers, and researchers in analyzing price trends, depreciation, and other key factors affecting car value.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, sourced from [Cars.com](https://www.cars.com), includes 4,009 listings with nine features:
- **Brand & Model**: Vehicle make and model.
- **Model Year**: Manufacturing year, indicating depreciation.
- **Mileage**: Total miles driven, impacting vehicle wear.
- **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel (e.g., gasoline, diesel, electric).
- **Engine Type**: Specifications affecting performance and efficiency.
- **Transmission**: Type of transmission (automatic, manual).
- **Exterior & Interior Colors**: Color options for aesthetic preferences.
- **Accident History**: Indicator of prior accidents, influencing value.
- **Clean Title**: Vehicle’s title status, affecting resale value.
- **Price**: Listed selling price for price comparison and budgeting.

This comprehensive dataset serves as a robust resource for automotive analysis and consumer preference studies.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Data imputation, encoding categorical features, and normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualization of key factors and correlations influencing price.
3. **Modeling**: Built regression models, such as Linear Regression and Random Forest, to predict prices.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed model accuracy with metrics like RMSE and R-squared.

## Key Features
- **Accurate Price Predictions**: Predictive tool for estimating car prices.
- **Insights on Price Factors**: Analysis of features that significantly affect prices.
- **Comprehensive Data Visualizations**: Graphical insights into data trends and distributions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Modeling**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and other regression models.

## Usage
Clone the repository, run the Jupyter Notebook for data processing, model training, and predictions.

## Future Enhancements
Enhancements may include integrating additional data, further model tuning, and deploying the model with a user-friendly web interface.
